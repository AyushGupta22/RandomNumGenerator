# RandomNumGenerator
It has two files
1. rand.py contains the main logic of code which takes two main inputs min limit and max limit and two optional limit n represents number of random numbers a user want to generate and second seed if user wants to give initial value from its side.
2. test.py contains code which is used to take input min, max , n and gives output of n random numbers + percentage of higher random numbers generated by our random algo.

Our random algo simply uses Bill's generator in which we multipy the seed with a fixed number then add it with another fixed number . Then the result gets shifted and bitwise '&' is done with a particular fixed number. To take number within our limit we simply take modulus with our limit.

Regarding generating 73% of higher number . I just triple the higher number by doubling the limit and map the higher numbers in the double limit list. Thus probablity of getting higher number with smaller number increases to 3:1 . Thus get around 73% probablity of higher number.
